🚀 DSA Roadmap for Java (Step-by-Step Guide)

This roadmap will take you from beginner to advanced in DSA using Java with proper Java methods for each concept.

⸻

✅ Step 1: Master Java Fundamentals (If Not Already)

Before diving into DSA, make sure you are comfortable with:
✔️ Variables, Data Types, Operators
✔️ Loops (for, while, do-while)
✔️ Functions & Recursion
✔️ Arrays & Strings
✔️ OOP Concepts (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, etc.)

If you’re good with this, move to Step 2!

⸻

✅ Step 2: Learn Recursion (Base of DSA)

🔹 Topics to Cover:
1.	Factorial of a Number
2.	Fibonacci Series
3.	Sum of Digits of a Number
4.	Reverse a String Using Recursion
5.	Power of a Number (a^b)
6.	Backtracking Basics (N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, etc.)

📌 Why?
Recursion is heavily used in trees, graphs, backtracking, and dynamic programming.

⸻

✅ Step 3: Learn Arrays & ArrayLists

🔹 Topics to Cover:
1.	Find Maximum/Minimum in an Array
2.	Reverse an Array
3.	Check if an Array is Sorted
4.	Find First and Last Occurrence of an Element
5.	Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick Sort)
6.	Binary Search & Its Variants

📌 Why?
Arrays are fundamental to all DSA topics, including sorting and searching.

⸻

✅ Step 4: Learn Linked List

🔹 Topics to Cover:
1.	Singly Linked List (Insert, Delete, Reverse, Find Middle)
2.	Doubly Linked List (Insert, Delete, Reverse)
3.	Detect & Remove Cycle in a Linked List
4.	Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists

📌 Why?
Used in memory management, stacks, queues, and graphs.

⸻

✅ Step 5: Learn Stack & Queue

🔹 Topics to Cover:
1.	Stack Using Array & Linked List
2.	Queue Using Array & Linked List
3.	Implement Stack Using Queue & Vice Versa
4.	Balanced Parentheses Problem
5.	Next Greater Element

📌 Why?
Stacks are used in function calls, parsing expressions, while queues are used in task scheduling, BFS traversal, etc.

⸻

✅ Step 6: Learn Hashing (HashMap, HashSet)

🔹 Topics to Cover:
1.	HashMap Basics (Key-Value Pairs, Get/Put Operations)
2.	Find Duplicates in an Array Using HashMap
3.	Find the First Non-Repeating Character in a String
4.	Find Intersection of Two Arrays
5.	Sort Elements by Frequency Using HashMap

📌 Why?
Hashing is super fast for searching and counting.

⸻

✅ Step 7: Learn Trees & Binary Search Tree (BST)

🔹 Topics to Cover:
1.	Binary Tree (Insert, Delete, Search)
2.	Tree Traversal (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder, Level Order)
3.	Find Height of a Tree
4.	Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree
5.	Binary Search Tree (BST) – Insert, Delete, Search

📌 Why?
Used in file systems, databases, and search engines.

⸻

✅ Step 8: Learn Graphs & Graph Algorithms

🔹 Topics to Cover:
1.	Graph Representation (Adjacency Matrix/List)
2.	Depth First Search (DFS)
3.	Breadth First Search (BFS)
4.	Detect Cycle in a Graph (DFS & BFS)
5.	Shortest Path Algorithm (Dijkstra’s Algorithm)

📌 Why?
Graphs are used in Google Maps, social networks, and recommendation systems.

⸻

✅ Step 9: Learn Dynamic Programming (DP)

🔹 Topics to Cover:
1.	Fibonacci Series Using DP (Memoization & Tabulation)
2.	Climbing Stairs Problem
3.	Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
4.	Knapsack Problem
5.	Coin Change Problem

📌 Why?
DP is heavily tested in coding interviews.

⸻

✅ Step 10: Learn Advanced Topics (Optional)
1.	Tries (Used in Dictionary, Auto-Suggestions)
2.	Segment Trees (Used in Range Queries)
3.	Bit Manipulation (Used in Competitive Coding)
4.	Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree - BIT)
